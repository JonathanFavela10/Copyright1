		<p>I think that the signs of success will be that there will be very little piracy and pirates trying to download or take credit for things other people have done. I also feel that another sign of success would be that the people of the world would feel secure about putting their intellectual property on the web. That they have the feeling of security and they have nothing to worry about anything.<p>
